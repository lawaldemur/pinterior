# Pinterior
We are inspired by the reality that humans are highly visual creatures. Pinterest is already capitalizing on this visual affinity by allowing people to create visual boards. We believe that AI can help users take their creativity a step further and reimagine their actual living spaces using their boards as inspiration.

Pinterior allows you to visualize how different aesthetics and designs would look in your actual living space.
